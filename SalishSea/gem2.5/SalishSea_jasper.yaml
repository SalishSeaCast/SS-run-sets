# salishsea command processor run description example
#
# Salish Sea full domain with:
#   Smoothed JdF mouth bathymetry
#   Initial T and S from previous day run restart file
#   Open, unstructured western boundary across Strait of Juan de Fuca
#     Tidal forcing at mouth of JdF
#     Masson, depth corrected, open boundaries
#   Open, unstructured northern boundary across Johnstone Strait
#     Tidal forcing just north of Port Nelson
#     Seasonal T and S forcing based on Thomson (1982)
#  All rivers run-off forcing
#     Fraser is based on actual daily average gauge data at Hope
#     All other rivers are monthly climatologies
#  Atmospheric forcing with 2.5km EC GEM operational model products
#    Constrained to no solid precipitation
