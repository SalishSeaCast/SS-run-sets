# salishsea command processor run description for Salish Sea case
#
# Salish Sea full domain with:
#   extra smoothed topography
#   start from spin-up TS
#   Open, unstructured western boundary across Strait of Juan de Fuca
#     Tidal forcing at mouth JdF
#     Masson, depth corrected, open boundaries
#  All River Monthly run-off forcing
#  Atmospheric forcing turned off
#    All tides only
