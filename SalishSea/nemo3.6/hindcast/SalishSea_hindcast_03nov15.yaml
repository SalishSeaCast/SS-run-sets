# salishsea command processor run description example for NEMO-3.6
#
# Salish Sea Deepened Long River Domain (down by one) with:
#     Tidal forcing
#     Salinity and Temperate at Both open boundaries
#  Rivers run-off forcing
#  Atmospheric forcing with operational GEM2.5 model products
#    Constrained to no solid precipitation
#  SMELT biological model

config_name: SMELT

# How is the domain to be distributed over the processors in the
# i (longitude) and j (latitude) directions?
# These values are used to set the nammpp namelist jpni & jpnj values
# and to set the number of processors and nodes in the PBS script
