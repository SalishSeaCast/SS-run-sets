# salishsea command processor run description example for NEMO-3.6
#
# Salish Sea full domain with:
#   Smoothed JdF mouth bathymetry
#   S4-1 uniform initial T and S, depth corrected
#   Open, unstructured western boundary across Strait of Juan de Fuca
#     Tidal forcing at mouth of JdF
#     Masson, depth corrected, open boundaries
#   Open, unstructured northern boundary across Johnstone Strait
#     Tidal forcing just north of Port Nelson
#     Seasonal T and S forcing based on Thomson (1982)
#  Rivers run-off forcing
#  Atmospheric forcing with operational GEM2.5 model products
#    Constrained to no solid precipitation

# How is the domain to be distributed over the processors in the
# i (longitude) and j (latitude) directions?
# These values are used to set the nammpp namelist jpni & jpnj values
# and to set the number of processors and nodes in the PBS script
