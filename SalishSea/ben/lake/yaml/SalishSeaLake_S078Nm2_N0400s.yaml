# salishsea command processor run description example for NEMO-3.6

# Name of the NEMO-3.6 configuration to use for the run;
# i.e. your NEMO-3.6-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG/ configuration directory
config_name: SalishSeaIdeal

# How is the domain to be distributed over the processors in the
# i (longitude) and j (latitude) directions?
# These values are used to set the nammpp namelist jpni & jpnj values
# and to set the number of processors and nodes in the PBS script
MPI decomposition: 5x19

# For runs on systems that use qsub/PBS/TORQUE
#
# If relative, paths are taken from current directory
run_id: SalishSeaLake_S078Nm2_N0400s
# Maximum run time requested/allowed for job
# Too low and you job will be terminated before it finishes
# Too high and you will have to wait longer on the queue for your job to start
# You have to experiment to find the "just right" value
walltime: 03:00:00
# Email address to send job begin, end, and abort notifications to
# If missing, email address is set to ${USER}@eos.ubc.ca
email: bmoorema@eoas.ubc.ca

# For runs on systems that use sbatch/SLURM
#
# **Optional**
# Account name to charge resources used by the job to
# If missing, account defaults to rrg-allen on cedar and def-allen on
# other systems
account: def-allen

paths:
  # Absolute path to NEMO-3.6 CONFIG/ directory.
  # You can use ~, $USER, $HOME if you wish.
  NEMO code config: $HOME/MEOPAR/NEMO-3.6-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG
  # If relative, paths below are taken from current directory
  # You can use ~, $USER, $HOME if you wish.
  XIOS: $HOME/MEOPAR/XIOS-2
  # Directory in which to create temporary run directories
  # Typically NOT inside a version control repository
  runs directory: $SCRATCH/Results/Lake/SalishSeaLake_S078Nm2_N0400s

grid:
  # If relative, paths are taken from the grid/ directory in the forcing
  # path below
  coordinates: $HOME/MEOPAR/grid/coordinates_seagrid_SalishSea201702.nc
  bathymetry: $HOME/MEOPAR/grid/bathymetry_201702.nc
  # Optional path/filename for land processor elimination MPI-LPE mapping
  # file that matches bathymetry;
  # If "land processor elimination:" key is absent or has the value "False",
  # land processor elimination is disabled
  land processor elimination: false

forcing:
  # The keys below are the names of symlinks that will be created.
  # The targets of those symlinks will be the paths named by the associated
  # "link to:" keys;
  # e.g. a symlink named NEMO-atmos will be created to
  # /results/forcing/atmospheric/GEM2.5/operational/
  #
  # The keys are directory names that you use as "cn_dir" values in your
  # namelists.
  #
  # You only need to include keys that are used in the namelist(s) for
  # your run.
  #
  # If relative, paths are taken from forcing path above
  grid:
    link to: $HOME/MEOPAR/grid

namelists:
  # The namelist section files in the lists below will be concatenated
  # to create a namelist file whose name is the key under which the files
  # are listed. The keys are the names of the namelist files that NEMO-3.6
  # expects.
  #
  # The only required key is namelist_cfg.
  #
  # If relative, paths are taken from current directory
