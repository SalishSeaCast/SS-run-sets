# salishsea command processor run description for Salish Sea case
#
# Spin-up run
#
# Salish Sea full domain with:
#   Smoothed JdF mouth bathymetry
#   S4-1 uniform initial T and S, depth corrected
#   Open, unstructured western boundary across Strait of Juan de Fuca
#     Tidal forcing
#     Masson model, depth corrected, T, S, U & V
#   Monthly climatology river run-off forcing, all rivers
#   Atmospheric forcing from CGRF dataset
#     Atmospheric pressure as inverse sea surface height effect enabled
