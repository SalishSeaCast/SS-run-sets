# salishsea command processor run description for Salish Sea case
#
# Salish Sea full domain with:
#   Smoothed JdF mouth bathymetry
#   T+S from 18oct25oct spin up
#   Open, unstructured western boundary across Strait of Juan de Fuca
#     Tidal forcing at mouth JdF
#     SSH forcing at mouth JdF
#     Masson, depth corrected, open boundaries
#  All River Monthly run-off forcing
#   Atmospheric forcing with CGRF products
#     Constrained to no solid precipitation
