# salishsea command processor run description for Salish Sea case
#
# Salish Sea full domain with:
#   Stratification from nov spin up file
#   Open, unstructured western boundary across Strait of Juan de Fuca
#     Tidal forcing at north and west, flux corrected and phase shifted
#     SSH forcing at north and west
#     No temperature and salinity forcing
#   Monthly river run-off
#   Atmospheric forcing with CGRF products
#     Constrained to no solid precipitation
