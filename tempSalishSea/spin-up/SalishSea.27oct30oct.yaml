# salishsea command processor run description for Salish Sea case
#
# Salish Sea full domain with:
#   Smoothed JdF mouth bathymetry
#   S4-1 uniform initial T and S, depth corrected
#   Open, unstructured western boundary across Strait of Juan de Fuca
#     Tidal forcing at mouth JdF
#     Masson, depth corrected, open boundaries
#  All River Monthly run-off forcing
#  Atmospheric forcing with CGRF products
#    Constrained to no solid precipitation
